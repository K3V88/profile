      <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Kevin and i'm 34 years old. I was born and raised in the Netherlands,
          and moved to Switzerland around 8 years ago. During my studies I lived in Austria
          for a year, where I did an exchange semester, and an internship as a market analyst in Vienna.
          During covid times, I unexcpectedly got way more time for my hobbies, one of course being programming.
          This re-discovered passion for coding is what made me end up at Le Wagon!

        <p>
          After finishing my studies of International Business and Languages,
          I travelled around the world and met many cool people from different cultures.
          After returning to the Netherlands, I felt like it was time for a new challenge, and
          moved to Zürich, where I started working in the airline business.<br><br> After working
          there for 6 years, the pandemic struck the world. Because of flight bookings diminishing,
          there was not a load of work to do, resulting in 'short-time work'. Now that
          I had a lot of time on my hands, I started coding as a hobby again, which I did
          a lot as a kid.

      <p>
          During my free time I love to spend time on my hobbies. As briefly mentioned before, coding is something that I have always loved
          to do, and therefore you can a lot of times find me in my home office, playing around with web development and using my creativity
          to create various masterpieces in the form of websites or applications. <br><br>My love for being creative also shows itself in my passion for art. I love painting, drawing and designing beautiful things in general.
          In my spare time I have created many paintings, most of them being about dinosaurs, which I liked since I started watching Jurassic Park as a young kid.<br><br>
          Even though I am not a big sports fan, I am absolutely addicted to Formula 1. Besides competing in online leagues on PS5, I try to watch
          every F1 race whenever I can. Highlights of my F1-fan career were going to the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona to watch it live, and meeting <a href="https://scontent-zrh1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/277586626_5140209796001562_2688161825384120989_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=174925&_nc_eui2=AeFGOTPRd2uRMohkL9dSNNWbLrmaK_2NW48uuZor_Y1bj-sKIAihjPqFiWrjZmi7kdRJwC0cxfWwI7hCbuA02whW&_nc_ohc=7uTwSysMvxIAX-R5BIX&_nc_ht=scontent-zrh1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBvx7Lw6cXsosFn7cE7SOcc1SWo9bCwZSD5AIwpttlYCQ&oe=64D65957" target="_blank">Lewis Hamilton</a> in person at the airport in Zürich by a totally random coincidence.
          <br><br>After my airport career, I succumbed to the travel-virus, so whenever I get the chance, I like to book a plane ticket to any place in the world, I just love travelling. More about that on the next topic.

      <p>
        I was born and raised in the land of tulips and windmills, the Netherlands, from a Swiss mother and a Dutch father.
        Because of my family being from different countries, I grew up with travelling. Every summer we used to visit my grandmother in Zürich, who would sometimes babysit us (my brother, sister and me) whenever my parents went on holiday alone.
        <br><br>This finally made me decide to move to Switzerland and start my job at the airport, where I had the possibility to buy plane tickets with big discounts. Whenever the opportunity presented itself, my girlfriend and I went on a trip, even if it was just for 2 days.<br><br>
